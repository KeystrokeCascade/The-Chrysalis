# Fallout: Equestria - The Chrysalis
Equestria was a land of love, once.  Even with the growing paranoia of war, that love never really disappeared.  To a changeling, it could be a dangerous place, but there were no better feeding grounds in the world.

Two centuries later, a changeling wakes to find herself alone.  The world she remembers is gone, scoured away under the fury of balefire.  In its place is a barren wasteland, where ponies fight to cling to life; where love has been trampled underhoof in the name of survival.

And this lone changeling must head out into that loveless land, seeking a hive that may no longer exist.
